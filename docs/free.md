So, you want to know more.  

Here are three things that will eat your profits, your time, and your energy:
- Failure to Degate
- Barriers to Purchase
- Red Herrings

Resolving these three things will prepare you for the larger task of regaining control of your business, and your life.

# Failure to Delegate
This one can take many forms.  
In the most simple form, it results in you doing all the operational bits of running an organization, like shopping for toilet paper and making sure there's coffee in the lobby.  
If you're still sweeping the floors when you should be closing corporate teambuilding agreements, something is very wrong.

Stop micro-managing.  

Make a list of everything you do.  
Sort this list into things that only _you_ can do, and things other people can do.  
Any recurring tasks get delegated to someone else **today**.

Simple as that.  

# Barriers to Purchase
If your players aren't able to get tickets by one or two clicks from your homepage, you're losing sales.

Checkout has to be fast, easy, and safe.  

The more clicks between the person wanting to play your game and a solid committment to do so, the more likely that they'll get cold feet, or decide to go to a movie instead.

Put a "Buy Now" button on your homepage, with a dropdown in the cart for selecting what to buy.

# Red Herrings
Your players are *always* going to think something is part of the game.

Even if there's a sign over it saying "Do Not Touch".

Use feedback cards for both your actors (you're using actors, right?) and your players, and routinely sit in on a game to see how players are getting distracted from the real game by the pattern on the light switches.

Then, change the light switches.  

_(switches are a metaphore for whatever the players are getting distracted by.)_
_(you must be willing to change the game room, and do so regularly to simplify the environment.)_
